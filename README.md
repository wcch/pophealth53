popHealth
=========

popHealth is a reporting tool that leverages the [Laika](http://projectlaika.org/) model to allow users to create dynamic queries on population health based on HITSP C32 patient records.

The source code is being refactored, so the repository will be in flux over the next few weeks. If you are interested in previous releases of popHealth, you can find them in the [Legacy Branch](http://github.com/pophealth/popHealth/tree/legacy)
