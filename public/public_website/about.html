	    </div>
        <p>The popHealth project is being funded and directed by the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/fedhealtharch/" target="_external">Federal Health Architecture</a> (FHA) program, Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT at the Department of Health and Human Services. The design, development, and implementation of the popHealth software is being led by the <a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_external">MITRE Corporation</a> with direct FHA oversight.</p>
        <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/fedhealtharch/" target="_external"><img src="images/fha_logo_small.png" alt="Federal Health Architecture Logo" /></a>
        <p>The <b>Federal Health Architecture</b> is an E-Government Line of Business initiative.  It is a response to the President's Management Agenda, which calls for increased efficiency and effectiveness in all government operations.</p>
        <p>FHA and its federal partners are helping build a federal health information technology environment that is interoperable with private sector systems and supports the President’s plan to enable better point-of-service care, increased efficiency and improved overall health in the U.S. population.</p>
        <p>FHA is responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
		  <li>Leveraging federal expertise by creating a federal health information sharing environment</li>
          <li>Supporting federal efforts to develop and adopt health IT standards and services</li>
		  <li>Ensuring that federal agencies can seamlessly exchange health data among themselves, with state, local and tribal governments, and with private-sector healthcare organizations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>FHA is managed from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT at the Department of Health and Human Services and is driven by the President's health IT plan, which calls for the widespread use of interoperable electronic health records by 2014 (<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/fedhealtharch/">http://www.hhs.gov/fedhealtharch/</a>).</p>
        <a href="http://www.mitre.org/" target="_external"><img src="images/mitre_logo_small.png" alt="The MITRE Corporation Logo" /></a>
        <p>The <b>MITRE Corporation</b> is a not-for-profit organization chartered to work in the public interest.  MITRE manages four federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs). An FFRDC is a unique organization that assists the United States government with scientific research and analysis, development and acquisition, and systems engineering and integration.  MITRE also has its own independent research and development program that explores new technologies and new uses of technologies to solve our sponsors’ problems in the near-term and in the future (<a href="http://www.mitre.org">www.mitre.org</a>).</p>
