# This class provides helper methods for working with sections in a C32 document
# Users should extend this module in their classes. For this module to work properly
# it expects a template_id, import_entries and entry_xpath class methods to be provided by the class
# extending it

  # Gets a secton Element. Will call template_id to find the appropriate id to place in it's XPath expression

  end
  
  # Using a section Element, this method will pull out the entries. Entries are the C32 term for data points in a document
  # Like an individual medication. This will call the entry_xpath method to find the XPath expression that should be used
  # to find the entries. You don't need to provide an XPath expression that will return just the entry tag, as the useful
  # data is often nested several tags down.
  def entries(section_element)
    REXML::XPath.match(section_element, entry_xpath, DEFAULT_NAMESPACES)

  # Pulls the entry elements from the section element. Once it has the entry Elements, it will pass them to an import_entry
  # method to do the job of extracting the data and putting it into an ActiveRecord object
